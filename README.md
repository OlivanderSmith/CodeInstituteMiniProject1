## Sleeper

This project was built for the purpose of completing the User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project from CodeInstitute.

CodeInstitute provide the option to step away from a template website and to create something of our own, if we so wish. It has always been my desire to only build things that may in some way be useful to the world and thus I conceived the idea of Sleeper as a project I could continue to work on outside of the scope of this Milestone project.

This ulterior purpose for the project is as the beginning of an experiment to see if enough interest can be built to help raise money for the increasing homeless crisis in Dublin. The methods for aid involve a political economics theory called Universal Basic Income. Various experiments of this kind have been conducted by charitys and government organisations around the globe but never in Ireland. Thus, if I can establish the right connections and momentum is built I would like to this this opportunity to do some good while learning to code on the side :P

## UX

This site is designed to meet the criterion of the Milestone project so users should find that it is responsive to all screen sizes and usability is compatible for the visually impaired.

It serves predominantly as a placeholder until further functionality can be built into it (such as the ability to accept donantions and track progress - visualise data etc.). For now it provides links to key information regarding the purpose of Universal Basic Income (UBI) in aid work and how various experiments have been conducted in other parts of the world so far.

A typical user should see that the cause is trying to create social mobility for rough sleepers in Dublin and use this newfound knowledge to contribute via various means of support.

## Features

The site contains only basic information features. Each page starts with a uniform Nav bar and footer, respectively.

Each page also contains a carousel that provides links to external sources of information on UBI, how to provide support for UBI, current/completed research on UBI particularly in the case of charities/organisations for the poor.

There is also a contact form though we have not yet studied how to connect our sites to any form of back-end that can take and store information so this contact form only serves to provide a pop up with an email contact so it's functionality is still limited.

## Features still to implement

- Contact form must be able to take information

- Donations page must be built and able to take payments

- Partnerships page must be built once partnerships have been established

- Statistics/data to be gathered and visualised in a meaningful way to help establish cause for aid

## JavaScript

Although not part of the scope of the Milestone Project I used some small amounts of JS for DOM manipulation. The purpose of the JS used was purely for presentation and UX.

## Testing

Although there will always be scope to improve UX/UI the function-lite nature of the site means there is little to go wrong.

- All links have been tested to lead to the correct destination
- All screen sizes have been tested for responsiveness and UX
- All information has been checked for suitability for all possible users
- All assets are licensed correctly

## Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub pages. The development version of the site sits with a GitHub repository found at: https://github.com/OlivanderSmith/CodeInstituteMiniProject1

I received inspiration for this project from my sister, Kate Smith, who is an avid economist and carer, whose knowledge and passion of the subjects of both Irish homelessness and UBI helped create this project.
